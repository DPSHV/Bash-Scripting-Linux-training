🐚 Bash & Linux Bootcamp – Practical Scripting for Sysadmins

This repository documents my focused learning journey through Bash scripting and Linux system administration from the ground up, with a clear goal:
build real-world, production-grade tools useful in day-to-day infrastructure work.

💡 What you'll find here

📜 Scripts written and iterated manually, not generated or copied

🛠️ Tools focused on user management, log parsing, filesystem operations, process control, and more

🧩 Each script supports flags, validation, and debugging logic

💻 Everything is built with real sysadmin use-cases in mind — audits, reporting, automation, and debugging

🔍 Examples
Day	Focus Area	Example Scripts
1–3	Files, permissions	file_report.sh, perm_check.sh
4–5	Processes, search	user_process_report.sh, txt_backup.sh
6	Streams, functions	log_cleaner.sh, archive_dir.sh
7	Users & groups	user_checker.sh, group_check.sh

More coming soon — each day adds new tooling and scripting depth.
