# 🐧 Linux & Bash System Scripts

A collection of **lightweight, production-style scripts** for Linux servers.  
They show how a few lines of Bash plus standard tools can solve real problems without heavy monitoring stacks.

## 🚀 Why these scripts are useful
- **Quick insights** → check CPU, RAM, disk, processes in seconds.  
- **Lightweight monitoring** → simple thresholds with timestamped logs.  
- **Automation** → cleanup tasks and health checks you can drop into cron or CI/CD.  
- **Production-ready style** → safe flags, error handling, logging, exit codes.

## 📂 What’s inside
- **System reports** → snapshots of system health.  
- **Monitoring & alerts** → log warnings when limits are exceeded.  
- **Cleanup utilities** → free up disk space automatically.  

Small, transparent, and portable — ideal for servers, VMs, or containers where you need fast results without extra dependencies.

📌 *These scripts are practical, easy to adapt, and designed to give you control and visibility over your systems with minimal effort.*
