# 🐧 Linux + Bash Bootcamp — Project Scripts

This repository is part of the **Linux + Bash Bootcamp** and shows how Bash combined with core Linux tools can be turned into **practical, production-style utilities**.  
The focus is on scripts that are small, transparent, and directly useful in day-to-day sysadmin and DevOps work.

## 🚀 Why these scripts are valuable
- **Lightweight** → no agents, no dependencies, just Bash and standard Linux tools.  
- **Practical** → generate system reports, monitor thresholds, automate cleanup.  
- **Transparent** → every line is easy to read, adapt, and extend.  
- **Production-ready style** → logging, error handling, exit codes, safe defaults.  

They fill the gap between *ad-hoc one-liners* and *full monitoring platforms* like Zabbix or Prometheus.

## 📂 What you’ll find
- **System reports** for quick health snapshots.  
- **Monitoring & alerts** that log when resources exceed limits.  
- **Cleanup scripts** to free space automatically.  

Each script is small enough to run on a VM, container, or server without setup — but solid enough to integrate into cron, systemd timers, or CI/CD pipelines.

📌 *These scripts are useful because they are simple, portable, and practical. They won’t replace enterprise tools — but they give you control, speed, and a clear view of what’s happening on your system.*
